"Hello world" created in IBM Quantum Experience circuit composer

This python code was automatically generated by creating my first circuit in the circuit composer while working with the IBM quantum experience. It consists of three qubits and three classical bits. The circuit activates by running the code top to bottom. h[q0] is a command that acts on qubit 0 by putting it into a superposition. The measurement will have equal probabilities to be either 0 or 1. On the visual Bloch Sphere, it can be represented as a shift of pi radians around an axis. cx[q0, q1] represents a Controlled Not gate, the two parameters being qubits 0 and 1. In this gate, if q0 has a value of 1, q1 will be passed through a NOT gate (become a 0). Otherwise the qubits are unchanged. The last line that says measure q[0] -> c[0] just collapses the value of the first qubit and maps its value onto a classical bit.
